            Your PR has been built, tested with a real executable, and pushed to Docker Hub:
            
            **‚úÖ Testing Results:**
            - Certificate validation: PASSED
            - Real executable signing: PASSED  
            - Signature verification: COMPLETED
            
            **Latest PR image:**
            \`\`\`bash
            docker pull ${imageTag}

            \`\`\`bash
            # This image has been tested with a real certificate and executable
            # You can test with your own certificate and executable:

            **Note:** This PR image was automatically tested by:
            - Validating the certificate from \`CERTIFICATE_BASE64\` secret
            - Downloading and signing a real Windows executable (7zr.exe)
            - Verifying the signature was applied successfully
